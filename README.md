# CookingAppFrontend

Simple app which allows you to browse, create, update and delete cooking recipes.

Currently it is making requests to drf backend that I host on Heroku - https://cooking-app-backend-vasil-loz.herokuapp.com/api/recipes/ .

## Technologies used:
I used page.js and lit-html. Currently I am using BootStrap for some of the views, however I am working on removing it entirely, because I want to make this app use only my personal CSS.
